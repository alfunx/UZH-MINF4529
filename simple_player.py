"""
Kingsheep Agent Template

This template is provided for the course 'Practical Artificial Intelligence' of the University of ZÃ¼rich. 

Please edit the following things before you upload your agent:
    - change the name of your file to '[uzhshortname]_A1.py', where [uzhshortname] needs to be your uzh shortname
    - change the name of the class to a name of your choosing
    - change the def 'get_class_name()' to return the new name of your class
    - change the init of your class:
        - self.name can be an (anonymous) name of your choosing
        - self.uzh_shortname needs to be your UZH shortname

The results and rankings of the agents will be published on OLAT using your 'name', not 'uzh_shortname', 
so they are anonymous (and your 'name' is expected to be funny, no pressure).
